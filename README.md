- 👋 Hi, I’m @graphicfunk
- 👀 I’m interested in Python and PyGame to create games. Basically action games, racing, card games, pinball machine and games with cool graphics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate in the near future. Right now I am going through the pleasant pain of intermediate learning and often I wish I could discourse on some topics.
- 📫 How to reach me: my e-mail graphicfunk@ msn.com. I am in Jersey City, NJ
      Previous experience c and c++, but these are in the past. Two years ago I decided to get back to c++
 but decided to try out Python. Well, I really loved it because of its OOP and here I am, having a blast.
